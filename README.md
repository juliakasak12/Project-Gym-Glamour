## ðŸ§± Page Object Model (POM) Design Pattern
The Page Object Model is a design pattern that separates test logic from the representation of the web pages. Each page of the application is represented by a class inside the pages/ directory. These classes contain:

### Element locators

- Interaction methods

- Assertions specific to the page

### Advantages:

- âœ… Easier code maintenance
- âœ… Improved readability
- âœ… Reusable components
